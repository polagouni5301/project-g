Hey Bolt,
I need you to create a spin wheel-based website with the following specifications:
### **Design Requirements:**
- Take background color inspiration from the attached screenshot.
- Build a **Spin Wheel** at the center of the page.
- In the middle of the spin wheel, display the text **"Wheel of Fortune"**.
- Below the spin wheel, add a button labeled **"Spin Now"**.
### **User Interaction Flow:**
1. When a user clicks the **"Spin Now"** button, a **pop-up dialog box** should appear in the center of the screen.
2. The pop-up should ask the user to **enter their ID**.
3. Once the user enters their ID and clicks the **"Go"** button:
   - The pop-up should disappear.
   - The **spin wheel should populate with the following rewards**, positioned around the wheel:
     - **Cheers & Earned Leave**
     - **Coffee with Tuhin & WFH Perks**
     - **WFH Perks & GD T-Shirt**
     - **GD T-Shirt & Water Bottle**
   - After a **4-second delay**, the wheel should start spinning.
### **Data Structure & Logic:**
- Create a **JSON dataset** of **20 guides**, each having an **ID** and an assigned **bucket**:
  - **Diamond:** Cheers & Earned Leave
  - **Gold:** Coffee with Tuhin & WFH Perks
  - **Silver:** WFH Perks & GD T-Shirt
  - **Bronze:** GD T-Shirt & Water Bottle
- When a user enters their ID:
  - Identify their **assigned bucket**.
  - Each bucket has **two possible rewards**.
  - Randomly pick **one** of the two rewards.
  - The spin wheel should **stop at the selected reward**.
  - Once the spin stops, display a **pop-up animation** showing the prize the user won.
### **Additional Features:**
- Add **smooth animations** to the spin wheel, pop-up box, and prize reveal animation.
- Ensure the website follows **best UI/UX practices** while keeping it visually appealing.
- Use **color inspiration from the attached screenshot**.
Now, **build the website as per the above requirements with high-quality animations and an engaging user experience.**
Hereâ€™s a detailed prompt to modify the existing spin wheel and make it more **beautiful, attractive, and professional**:
